# Windows utilities for laptops

### MonitorConnectTrigger

Automatically sets my Dell U2515H 'Input Source' to HDMI1 upon HDMI connection.

(If someone could write an equivalent for macOS that would be awesome! I switch need to manually switch the Input Source back to DisplayPort for my work macbook)

### StayWoke

Do not sleep the laptop on lid close if an external monitor is active
